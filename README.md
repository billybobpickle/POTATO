POTATO
======

POTATO is a very addicting, fun game that is designed to have you hooked on to the game until you win. It is where you start out as a small potato and then you eat smaller potatos then you get bigger. Once you get big enough, you will win. Designed by Jimmy Gloger and programed by Anthony Clemens.
